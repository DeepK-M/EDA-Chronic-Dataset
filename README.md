# 🏥 Chronic Disease Data: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a chronic disease dataset. The goal of this analysis is to identify key risk factors, trends, and patterns related to chronic diseases, helping in early detection and prevention strategies.

## 📌 Project Overview
Chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and hypertension significantly impact global health. This EDA explores:

Risk Factor Analysis: Identifying lifestyle, genetic, and environmental factors contributing to chronic diseases.
Demographic Influence: Examining how age, gender, and region affect disease prevalence.
Correlation Between Health Metrics: Analyzing relationships between BMI, blood pressure, glucose levels, and disease occurrence.
Trends in Disease Progression: Understanding patterns in disease onset and severity.

## 🔍 Key Insights
High BMI and blood pressure are strong predictors of chronic diseases.
Age and lifestyle factors significantly influence disease prevalence.
Early diagnosis and regular health check-ups reduce the risk of severe complications.
Preventive measures like diet and exercise have a strong impact on health outcomes.

## 📊 Data & Methodology
Dataset: Chronic disease data containing attributes like age, BMI, blood pressure, glucose levels, lifestyle habits, and diagnosis status.
Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
Methods Used: Data cleaning, outlier detection, correlation analysis, visualization, and statistical insights.

## 🚀 Future Scope
Building a predictive model for early disease detection.
Analyzing the impact of medications and treatments.
Exploring regional and genetic factors influencing chronic diseases.
